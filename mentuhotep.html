        <p>King Nebhepetre Mentuhotep II was revered by the Egyptians as the ruler who reunited Egypt after the era of
            disunity (the First Intermediate Period) that followed the end of the Old Kingdom. Descended from a family
            of Theban rulers, the king built his tomb and mortuary temple at Deir el-Bahri in western Thebes. This
            relief was originally part of the decoration of the temple's main sanctuary that was added to the building
            at the end of the king's reign.</p>
        <p>The fine balance between figures and inscriptions on this block, as well as the clear outline and regular
            proportions of the king's image with its individualized facial features, exemplify the peak of relief art
            that had developed over the decades while the vast temple complex was built and decorated. The figure of the
            goddess Hathor on the right of the block was chiselled away during the Amarna period, when King Akhenaten
            propagated the sole worship of the god Aten. Hathor was repaired in plaster in early Dynasty 19, and some of
            the paint on the whole block may also have been renewed at the time.</p>
