    <div class="section">
        <h2>The Egyptian Museum in Cairo</h2>
        <p>The Egyptian Museum in Cairo is one of the world's most renowned museums, housing an extensive collection of
            ancient Egyptian artifacts. Established in 1835, it stands as the oldest archaeological museum in the Middle
            East.</p>
        <img src="museums/1.jpg" alt="Egyptian Museum Image 1" style="width: 250px; height: auto;">

        <img src="museums/3.jpg" alt="Egyptian Museum Image 3" style="width: 250px; height: auto;">

        <h3>History and Establishment</h3>
        <p>The museum's inception dates back to August 15, 1835, when Muhammad Ali Pasha issued a decree to prevent the
            export of antiquities from Egypt. Initially, the collection was housed in the Azbakeya Garden, then moved to
            a hall in the Citadel of Salah al-Din. In 1858, under the guidance of French Egyptologist Auguste Mariette,
            a dedicated museum was established in Bulaq. After a flood in 1878, the artifacts were transferred to an
            annex of the Khedive Ismail Palace in Giza. Finally, in 1902, the current building in Tahrir Square was
            inaugurated during the reign of Khedive Abbas Helmy II.</p>

        <h3>Collections and Exhibits</h3>
        <p>The museum boasts over 170,000 artifacts spanning from the Prehistoric era to the Greco-Roman period. Notable
            collections include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Tutankhamun's Treasures:</strong> A comprehensive assemblage of items from the tomb of the young
                pharaoh, including his iconic gold mask.</li>
            <li><strong>Royal Mummies:</strong> A selection of mummified remains of prominent pharaohs and nobles.</li>
            <li><strong>Statuary and Stelae:</strong> Artifacts representing various deities, royalty, and daily life
                scenes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Visiting Information</h3>
        <ul>

                "Sadat" Station. The museum is a short walk from the station.</li>
            <li><strong>By Bus:</strong> Several bus routes pass through Tahrir Square. It's essential to verify the
                specific route numbers and stops.</li>
            <li><strong>By Taxi:</strong> Cairo's taxis are a convenient option. Ensure the driver uses the meter or
                agree on a fare beforehand.</li>
            <li><strong>Ride-Sharing Services:</strong> Services like Uber and Careem operate extensively in Cairo and
                can drop you directly at the museum's entrance.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Additional Notes</h3>
        <p>Given Cairo's bustling nature, it's recommended to plan your journey considering potential traffic delays.
            Visiting during weekdays and arriving early can provide a more relaxed experience.</p>

    <!-- Djoser’s Funerary Complex in Saqqara -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Djoser’s Funerary Complex in Saqqara</h2>
        <p>Djoser’s Funerary Complex is one of the most significant architectural achievements in ancient Egypt. Located
            in Saqqara, it was the first large-scale stone structure ever built. Designed by the brilliant architect and
            vizier Imhotep during the reign of King Djoser (c. 2667–2648 BCE), this complex marked a turning point in
            Egyptian funerary architecture and set the foundation for the later pyramids of Egypt.</p>
        <img src="museums/4.jpg" alt="Djoser’s Funerary Complex Design Image 1" style="width: 250px; height: auto;">
        <img src="museums/5.jpg" alt="Djoser’s Funerary Complex Design Image 2" style="width: 250px; height: auto;">

        <h3>Design and Main Features of the Complex</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>The Step Pyramid:</strong> The Step Pyramid is the centerpiece of the funerary complex and is
                considered the earliest pyramid built in Egypt. It was initially constructed as a traditional mastaba
                tomb, but Imhotep expanded it into a six-tiered structure, reaching about 60 meters (197 feet) in
                height.</li>
            <li><strong>The Enclosure Wall and Entrance:</strong> The entire complex is surrounded by a massive
                limestone wall, about 10.5 meters (34 feet) high, designed to resemble woven reed matting. It had 14
                false doors and only one real entrance, located in the southeast, symbolizing the passage into the
                afterlife.</li>
            <li><strong>The Courtyard for the Heb-Sed Festival:</strong> A vast ceremonial courtyard lies in front of
                the Step Pyramid, designed for the Heb-Sed Festival, an important ritual celebrating the king’s
                rejuvenation and divine power.</li>
            <li><strong>Temples and Religious Structures:</strong> The complex included multiple temples and shrines
                dedicated to Djoser’s cult and religious offerings.</li>
            <li><strong>Underground Chambers and Tunnels:</strong> Beneath the pyramid lies an extensive network of
                tunnels and galleries, stretching over 5.5 kilometers (3.4 miles).</li>
        </ol>


        <h3>Significance in Egyptian Architecture</h3>
        <p>The Step Pyramid Complex was the first large-scale construction made entirely of limestone, replacing earlier
            mudbrick structures. Imhotep introduced columns and stone facades, which influenced the architectural style
            of future Egyptian temples and tombs.</p>

        <h3>Rediscovery and Restoration</h3>
        <p>The complex was explored and excavated by archaeologists in the 19th and 20th centuries. In recent years,
            Egypt’s Ministry of Antiquities carried out major restoration efforts to stabilize the pyramid and restore
            the surrounding structures. In March 2020, the Step Pyramid and its complex were officially reopened to
            visitors after an extensive renovation.</p>

    <!-- Mortuary Temple of Mentuhotep II -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Mortuary Temple of Mentuhotep II</h2>
        <p>The temple's design was one-of-a-kind for its time. It was constructed on a platform with multiple levels,
            combining elements from earlier saff-tombs and the traditional Old Kingdom pyramid complex. Originally,
            there was a valley temple located beneath the cultivated area of the West Bank. A causeway, flanked by
            trees, led to a spacious forecourt (the causeway and tree-pits can still be seen today). While riding his
            horse in this forecourt, Howard Carter accidentally stumbled upon the entrance of a deep shaft known as 'Bab
            el-Hosan' (Gate of the Horse). This shaft was actually part of the Mentuhotep complex, and inside, Carter
            discovered the famous seated sandstone statue of Mentuhotep II in heb-sed costume, wrapped in linen. This
            statue is now housed in the Cairo Museum.</p>
        <img src="museums/8.jpg" alt="Mortuary Temple of Mentuhotep II Image 1">
        <img src="museums/9.jpg" alt="Mortuary Temple of Mentuhotep II Image 2">
        <img src="museums/10.jpg" alt="Mortuary Temple of Mentuhotep II Image 3">

        <h3>Design and Features</h3>
        <p>There are various theories about the purpose of 'Bab el-Hosan', but it is generally believed that it may have
            originally been intended as the king's tomb, later converted into a symbolic cenotaph of Osiris. The walled
            forecourt featured a row of colossal Osirid statues of the king and two smaller gates. The terraced temple
            appears to have been constructed in multiple phases, possibly three or four. A ramp connects to the second
            level, which was adorned with sycamore and tamarisk trees on both sides. The lower colonnade contained
            fragments of rear wall reliefs depicting boat processions and foreign campaigns.</p>
        <p>The upper terrace had a double colonnade of pillars with scenes and texts of Mentuhotep. It was surrounded by
            an ambulatory and a forest of 140 octagonal pillars. In the center, there was a large square structure made
            of limestone blocks. Egyptologists initially believed it to be the base of a pyramid, but now it is thought
            to be a mastaba-like structure representing the funerary chapel and symbolizing the primeval mound of
            creation.</p>

        <h3>Tombs and Chapels</h3>
        <p>Six shaft tombs were found on the west side of the second terrace behind the colonnade. Each tomb had its own
            chapel dedicated to a different female family member of Mentuhotep. The tombs, from right to left, belonged
            to Myt, Ashayt, Sadeh, Kauit, Kemsit, and Henhenit. Ashayt's sarcophagus and decorated wooden coffin are
            displayed in the Cairo Museum. It is believed that she was a Nubian consort of the king. Kauit, another
            consort, also has a large decorated sarcophagus in the Cairo Museum, along with a series of model coffins
            containing wax statuettes of the lady.</p>
        <p>On the north-western side of the second terrace, a small chapel dedicated to Hathor and other deities was
            built during the New Kingdom. In this chapel, a statue of the cow-goddess was discovered in a shrine, which
            is now housed in the Cairo Museum.</p>

        <h3>Royal Tomb and Symbolism</h3>
        <p>On the main platform of the structure's west side, there is a peristyle court on the second terrace. Inside,
            there are two rows of pillars and the royal tomb is located in the inner part. Mentuhotep's tomb was carved
            into the rock below the courtyard and had an uninscribed alabaster shrine. This tomb may have influenced the
            design of the royal tombs in the Valley of the Kings during the New Kingdom. A lot of wooden models and
            statuettes, intentionally shattered, were discovered in the chamber. Experts on ancient Egypt discuss
            whether the king was actually laid to rest in the tomb or if it served as a symbolic burial place for the
            pharaoh's 'ka' since no sarcophagus was uncovered.</p>

        <h3>Significance and Legacy</h3>
        <p>The Temple of Mentuhotep is a complex building, and the limited remains make it difficult to understand. The
            artwork suggests that Osiris, a god associated with death and the afterlife, gained more importance during
            this time. The temple's design includes both traditional and new elements. Its original name was
            'Akh-sut-Nebhepetre' which means 'Splendid are the cult places of Mentuhotep'.</p>

        <h3>Visiting Information</h3>
        <p>Mentuhotep's temple is not accessible to the general public, but there are occasions when you can request
            special permission to visit from the Antiquities Office.</p>
